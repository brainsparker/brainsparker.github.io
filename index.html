            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4>With over 10 years of product management experience, I am passionate about creating user-centric and revenue-driving solutions that solve real problems and delight customers.</h4> 
            <p></p>I am currently a Product Manager at you.com, the chat-search assistant. At you.com, I have successfully launched and scaled innovative chat features, such as searchable chat history and thread sharing, that boosted user acquisition by 15% and laid the groundwork for the you.com personal data moat. I have also increased mobile user conversions to sign-ups by two-fold through strategic iterations to the home page and query bar concept. Additionally, I have effectively monetized YouImagine, the creative app marketplace, by introducing Stripe as the primary payment processor, generating multiple six-figure ARR. Furthermore, I have led the introduction of the Open Platform, collaborating with internal teams and external partners to develop and bring to market over 10 innovative apps on you.com. I am Google Analytics Certified and have a strong background in marketing and video production, which enables me to leverage data and insights to optimize product performance and user experience. I also have extensive experience in search and discovery product areas, having defined and executed the search roadmap at Crate and Barrel and G2, resulting in significant revenue growth and user satisfaction. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to collaborate with diverse and talented teams to deliver value and impact.
