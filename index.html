      <p>
        I have over ten years of experience leading teams to build products
        that solve real problems and drive measurable growth. I have scaled
        consumer apps and guided high-performing teams to deliver great user
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        At You.com, I helped launch AI features that doubled user growth every
        six weeks and generated reliable revenue. I created new platforms with
        multiple apps and improved core tools that delivered strong returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned a B.S. in Marketing and I am completing an MBA at Boston
        University. I focus on using data and creativity to build products
        that improve peopleâ€™s lives.
