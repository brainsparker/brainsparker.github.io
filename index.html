      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a product leader who loves building things that make technology feel human. For more than a decade, I've helped teams turn complex systems into simple, valuable experiences that people actually want to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my work has centered on search, discovery, and AI — figuring out how to make information more useful, more contextual, and more connected. At You.com, I've played a key role in shaping how AI applications power modern search and knowledge experiences, helping the company grow into a leader in this space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I spent years in e-commerce and marketplaces, building search and recommendation products that made it easier for people to find what they were looking for. I studied Marketing and am completing my MBA at Boston University, where my focus has been on innovation, product strategy, and the intersection of business and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across all of it, I've stayed focused on the same goal: understanding what people need, then building the bridge between great technology and real human value.
