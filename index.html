            <p></p>I am a results-driven Product Leader with over 10 years of experience delivering innovative, user-centered products that solve real-world problems and drive measurable impact. I have a proven track record of scaling consumer apps and leading high-performing teams to deliver growth, innovation, and exceptional user experiences. At You.com, I spearheaded the development of AI-driven features, achieving 200% user acquisition growth every 6 weeks and generating six-figure ARR in 90 days through strategic monetization initiatives. My expertise lies in crafting product strategies that combine user needs, business objectives, and market trends. I have successfully launched 0-to-1 products, such as an Open Platform with 10+ apps at You.com, and scaled existing core offerings, like optimizing search experiences at Crate & Barrel, which delivered a seven-figure ROI within 30 days. I am passionate about leveraging Data, AI, and Behavioral Science to create products that are seamlessly integrated into users' everyday lives, driving both satisfaction and growth. 
            
            With a background in consumer apps, e-commerce, and tech, I have a demonstrated ability to lead cross-functional teams, mentor product managers, and foster a culture of curiosity and innovation. I hold a B.S. in Marketing from Full Sail University and am currently pursuing an MBA at Boston University Questrom School of Business. I am deeply committed to creating products that make a meaningful difference in users' lives.
